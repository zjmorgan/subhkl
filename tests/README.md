# Tests for subhkl

This contains the tests and data for subhkl

# Generating Test Data

The script `generate_test_data.py` in this directory
allows for generating the test data for the tests.

Yet, this script does require `mantid-framework` to be installed.

This is not part of the packages dependences or dev dependencies.
